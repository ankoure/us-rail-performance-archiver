          Transit agencies publish GTFS-Realtime as a <em>live snapshot</em> — ask an agency what
          its trains were doing last Tuesday and, almost everywhere, the answer is that nobody kept
          it. This project keeps it: every poll from every configured feed, landed raw and rolled up
          into open Parquet, continuously since {ARCHIVE_START}.

          It runs on hardware I pay for out of pocket — around{" "}

          funding it. If the bill stops getting paid, the archive doesn&rsquo;t just go offline; the
          history stops being recorded, and that gap can never be backfilled.
