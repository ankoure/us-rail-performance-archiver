class LandingUploader:
    """Drains local landing-zone objects to S3 on a background thread.

    Lifecycle is RAII via the async context-manager protocol so it nests in the
    poller's AsyncExitStack alongside the agency clients (see main.run). It owns
    exactly one worker thread for its whole lifetime, running two independent
    cadences from the same loop (see ``_run``):

    Metadata ships one small ``window=*.jsonl`` object at a time, as soon as
    one is materialized (``_scan_once_window``, paced by ``scan_interval``) --
    this half is unchanged from before content-addressed raw storage existed.

    Raw payloads ship as one zstd-compressed tar per window
    (``_maybe_ship_raw_windows``, paced independently by
    ``ship_window_seconds``, since PUT count against S3 is exactly what that
    cadence exists to bound). ``ContentAddressedWriter`` writes each poll's
    payload immediately to a content-hash-named ``{digest}.bin`` -- there's no
    ``window=*.bin`` file for a glob to find the way there is for metadata, so
    a closed window's digests are discovered by reading the feed's local
    ``data.jsonl`` directly (``_closed_windows``). Whichever of those digests
    still has a ``{digest}.bin`` present locally gets tarred and uploaded
    (``_ship_raw_window``); a ``.shipped`` marker then records that the
    window's metadata was handed off, because bin-absence alone can't mean
    "already shipped" here -- see ``_shipped_marker``'s docstring for why.
