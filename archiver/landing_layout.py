"""Single source of truth for landing-zone metadata-object identity, plus the
raw-payload tar key format.

Raw and metadata are no longer symmetric. `ContentAddressedWriter` writes each
poll's payload immediately to a content-hash-named `{digest}.bin` — there is
no `window=*.bin` file for a glob to find, so raw-payload *discovery* isn't
this module's job anymore: `LandingUploader`'s raw-tar shipping pass finds
which digests belong to a window by reading the local day's `data.jsonl`
directly (timestamp + digest per row), not by listing files here. This module
still owns two things: (1) metadata-object selection/keys (`WINDOW_OBJECT_GLOBS`,
`iter_window_objects`, `window_object_key`) — a window's metadata row-slice IS
still materialized to disk as a discoverable `window=*.jsonl` file, shipped by
the same generic scan `LandingUploader` and the one-shot `LandingBackfill`
(soak-phase parity) both use, so they can't drift apart — and (2) the raw tar's
S3 key shape (`window_tar_key`), computed directly rather than discovered,
since the caller already knows which window it just built a tar for.

Layout:
    {feed}/metadata/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/window=*.jsonl   (WINDOW_OBJECT_GLOBS)
    {feed}/raw/year=YYYY/month=MM/day=DD/window=*--shipped=*.tar.gz   (window_tar_key)
The daily `data.jsonl` (writer.py `append_metadata`) sits in the same metadata
directory but is local-only — it is excluded for free because its name doesn't
match `window=*`. Each glob `*` matches exactly one path segment (pathlib never
crosses "/"), so the metadata pattern is pinned to that depth on purpose; a
layout change in writer.py's metadata materialization must be reflected here.
