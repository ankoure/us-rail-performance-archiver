# ROLLUP_DAY can be set per run (override) to target a specific past day;
# defaults to yesterday-UTC. No prune: the landing.tf 7-day lifecycle expires S3
# landing, and the box no longer holds the curated tree.
#
# NOTE: this WAS split into three separate ECS tasks (rollup/gold/ship) chained
# by Step Functions, on the theory that a failed stage shouldn't silently
# re-run the ones before it. Reverted 2026-07-31: each Fargate task gets fresh
# ephemeral disk, and rollup/gold/ship all assume they share local disk within
# one container (curated_dir is a local Path — see archiver/rollup.py,
# gold.py, archiver/shipper.py). Splitting without shared storage (EFS, or
# teaching the Python classes to read/write curated data via S3) meant gold
# saw an empty curated/ and silently no-op'd every feed. Revisit the split
# once one of those is in place.

    # long-lived process don't reliably get returned to the OS even after correct
    # Python-level GC -- proven by adding correct per-agency cache eviction to
    # gtfs.py's resolver_cache and observing zero change in when the OOM hit. An
    # OS process boundary is the only thing that reliably reclaims it. gold.py's
    # own _make_gtfs_resolver() had the same unbounded-cache shape (a second,
    # previously-unknown instance of the same bug) -- fixed for free by this
    # restructure with zero code changes to gold.py, since invoking it once per

    # gtfs.py into the same per-agency isolation for the same reason.

    # restructured script (task 0b2143bc, day Aug 17), before agency_batch.py
    # ever got to start. Lesson: the identified caches were never the only
    # risk. ANY step handling the whole fleet sequentially in one long-lived
