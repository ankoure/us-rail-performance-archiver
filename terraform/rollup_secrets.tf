# --- Env secret (agency API keys + regional poller .env) ------------------ #
# Terraform creates the secret CONTAINER only; the value is put out-of-band so
# secrets never land in TF state/code.
#
# Two consumers now read this SAME secret, neither wanting the whole thing:
#   - The Fargate rollup task (rollup_iam.tf, rollup.tf) -- reads ONLY
#     DD_API_KEY (hardcoded on the datadog-agent container def). It never
#     builds a live feed client (archiver.loader.build_feeds() is metadata-
#     only), so it has no use for -- and, as of this file, no longer even
#     requests -- any agency key. Extra keys below are simply invisible to it.
#   - Each poller box's user_data (box_eu.tf/box_au.tf; box.tf's original
#     us-east-1 box still gets .env pasted by hand per deploy/README.md) --
#     fetches the blob at boot and filters it to that box's own continent
#     (scripts/agency_env_keys.py) plus the always-keep infra keys, via the
#     box_secrets_read policy (landing.tf). pipeline/refresh_env.py replays
#     the same fetch, unfiltered, when pushing a rotated/new key afterward --
#     see its TODO to apply the same continent filter.
#
# So the value must be a flat JSON object of every agency's auth env var
# (config/feeds.yaml) PLUS DD_API_KEY, DD_SITE, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
# AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (the poller's full un-filtered .env, minus
# continent/shard/hostname -- those are per-box, baked into user_data
# directly, not secret). Deliberately does NOT include every key that might
# be in a local dev .env (e.g. MBTA_API_KEY, DD_APP_KEY,
# POSTGIS_DATABASE_URL) -- only what config/feeds.yaml's auth blocks and
# compose.prod.yml actually reference. The key LIST used to be hand-maintained
# here and drifted stale more than once (missing TFNSW/PTV/AT_METRO/
# METRO_CHRISTCHURCH keys each broke something before anyone noticed) --
# scripts/agency_env_keys.py (no --continent) now computes it from
# config/feeds.yaml directly, so use that instead of retyping a list:
#
#   aws secretsmanager put-secret-value --secret-id rail-archiver/env \
#     --secret-string "$(python3 - <<'PY'
#   import json, subprocess

#   keys += ["DD_API_KEY", "DD_SITE", "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"]
#   env = dict(l.strip().split("=",1) for l in open(".env") if "=" in l and not l.startswith("#"))
#   print(json.dumps({k: env[k] for k in keys if k in env}))
