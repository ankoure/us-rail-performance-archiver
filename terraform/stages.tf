# --- Per-stage rollup tasks (phase 1 of the stage split) ------------------- #
#
# The nightly batch used to be ONE task at rollup_cpu/rollup_memory running every
# stage, which meant every stage was provisioned at the max of all of them:
# rollup is CPU-bound (Rust decode), gtfs/gold/snapshot are memory-bound, and the
# ships are I/O-bound. Sizing them together made headroom untargetable -- giving
# gold more memory meant giving rollup the same.
#
# These four stages read nothing that any OTHER STAGE writes (gtfs pulls static
# GTFS off the network, snapshot reads landing, cold-ship reads landing), so they
# split out with no shared-storage problem at all -- unlike gold, which reads
# rollup's silver parquet. That is what makes this safe where the 2026-07-31
# Step Functions split was not: see the NOTE in rollup.tf, where gold saw an
# empty curated/ and silently no-op'd every feed.
#
# snapshot and archive DO have a dependency on EACH OTHER, though: archive's
# prune_s3 deletes a landing day-partition once shipped, and must not run
# before snapshot has had its chance to read that day's raw payloads. That
# ordering is handled by the state machine in stage_orchestration.tf, same as
# gold's dependency on rollup -- see that file's header comment. So of the four,
# only gtfs is scheduled by a plain, un-ordered cron below.
#
# Each excludes only the agencies actually flagged for ITS OWN failure mode
# (heavy_stages.tf's local.heavy_stage_defs[name].agencies), not the full
# local.heavy_agencies list -- an agency isolated for gold.py (say,
# METRO_HOUSTON) has never been a gtfs.py or snapshot.py problem, so it runs
# gtfs/snapshot right here in the regular pool. Wiring these to
# heavy_stage_defs directly (rather than copy-pasting the same agency names
# twice) is what makes the two sides unable to drift apart, same principle as
# rollup.tf's main_stages being derived from var.stage_schedule_enabled.
#
# Regression fixed 2026-09-06, caught before it cost a single night: the
# first version of this split excluded the FULL heavy_agencies list from all
# four stages uniformly, then re-included each agency only in its own narrow
# heavy_stages.tf subset -- so e.g. GO_AHEAD (only ever flagged for gtfs.py)
# was excluded from stage-gold AND absent from heavy_gold's agency list,
# meaning its gold mart would never have been built by EITHER task, silently,
# every night. Same failure class as the GO_AHEAD outage described in
# rollup.tf's heavy_agencies comment -- excluded from one task without being
# re-included in the other -- just introduced by this split instead of a
# schedule left disabled.
#
# archive is the one exception: it still excludes the FULL heavy_agencies
# list, because cold-ship for all eight is handled by heavy_rollup, not by
# any of the narrower heavy_stages.tf subsets.
#
# Sizes below are deliberately generous first guesses, not measured values. Watch
# pipeline.<stage>.duration and the task memory graphs for a week before cutting
# any of them (same discipline as rollup_memory's history).
