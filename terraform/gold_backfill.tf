# --- gold-backfill: reprocess gold.py's metrics marts for past days, ------ #
# --- WITHOUT re-running rollup.py ------------------------------------------ #
# Manual-only — no EventBridge schedule, unlike rollup/cert_check/
# s3_storage_metrics. Invoke by hand after fixing a gold.py bug and wanting to
# reprocess a range of already-shipped days:
#
#   aws ecs run-task --cluster rail-archiver --launch-type FARGATE_SPOT \
#     --task-definition rail-archiver-gold-backfill \
#     --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={subnets=[<default-subnet-id>,...],securityGroups=[<rollup-sg-id>],assignPublicIp=ENABLED}" \
#     --overrides '{"containerOverrides":[{"name":"gold-backfill","environment":[
#       {"name":"FEEDS","value":"wmata-vehicles mbta-vehicles"},
#       {"name":"START_DAY","value":"2026-07-20"},
#       {"name":"END_DAY","value":"2026-08-01"}
#     ]}]}'
#
# See pipeline/gold_backfill.py's module docstring for why this pulls the
# already-shipped vehicles parquet back from the hot bucket instead of
# re-running rollup.py, and ships via Shipper.ship_one() directly instead of
# pipeline/ship.py's CLI.
