# --- Step Functions: the two real dependency edges (phase 2) --------------- #
#
# gtfs reads nothing any other stage writes, so it stays plainly scheduled
# (stages.tf) and needs no orchestration. Two pairs do have a real ordering
# requirement, each handled as its own branch of the Nightly Parallel state
# below -- the branches themselves are independent of each other and run
# concurrently:
#
#   Rollup -> Gold: gold reads rollup's silver, so it must not start until
#   rollup has finished AND shipped.
#
#   Snapshot -> Archive: archive's post-step is prune_s3, which deletes a
#   landing day-partition once its cold tarball is confirmed shipped. Cold-ship
#   used to run inside the same monolithic task as snapshot, after it, so a day
#   was never eligible for pruning before snapshot had already had its chance
#   to read that day's raw payloads. Splitting them into separate tasks removes
#   that implicit ordering -- archive could otherwise run before snapshot ever
#   starts. prune_s3 (archiver/shipper.py) now ALSO checks that an alerts-
#   capable feed has a snapshot object in S3 before deleting its landing data,
#   which is the correctness backstop for a feed that fails snapshot every
#   single night (see local.heavy_agencies in rollup.tf) -- ordering alone
#   can't help *that* case, since archive would just keep finding no snapshot
#   forever. This edge closes the narrower, cheaper-to-hit case: archive
#   racing ahead of a snapshot run that would otherwise have succeeded.
#
# Note the 2026-07-31 attempt used Step Functions too and was reverted, but the
# orchestration was never the problem: the problem was that gold and rollup ran
# in separate tasks with separate ephemeral disks and no way to share curated
# data, so gold saw an empty tree and silently no-op'd. That is fixed two ways
# now, both of which have to hold before this is safe to enable:
#   1. gold reads silver over S3 from the hot bucket (analysis/curated_fs.py),
#      so it no longer needs rollup's local disk at all; and
#   2. gold.assert_silver_present() makes an empty tree a non-zero exit instead
#      of a zero-row success, so the same mistake can't be silent twice.
# Snapshot -> Archive has no such hazard: archive's cold-ship reads landing
# (S3), not curated/, so it was never exposed to the shared-local-disk problem.
#
# ROLLUP_DAY is threaded through the execution input so a manual re-run of one
# past day drives all four tasks consistently: start an execution with
# {"day": "2026-09-02"} rather than running them by hand.

locals {
  # Both branches override ROLLUP_DAY from the execution input when present.
  # States.Format with a null-ish input would produce "None", so the default
  # empty string is resolved in-container by the script's `${ROLLUP_DAY:-...}`.
  # Both pairs are Task/.sync -> Task/.sync chains with an identical shape
  # (override ROLLUP_DAY, discard the ECS result so $.day survives, catch any
  # failure and proceed anyway), so the two branches below are structurally
  # twins -- see the header comment for what each edge is actually for.
